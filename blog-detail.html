                            A honeymoon is the perfect time to take a break from life and focus on each other. The first
                            few weeks after getting married can be stressful, but taking time to plan a trip will help
                            you ease into married life and have fun together in the process. There are so many things to
                            consider when planning your trip of a lifetime: where will you go? How long will it last?
                            What budget do you have? How much time off work do you need? These are all great questions
                            that need answers before hitting “book now” on your ticket. We’ve got everything you need to
                            know about planning and funding your ultimate honeymoon here!

                                <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Look into different accommodation options and booking

                                <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Write down a list of things you’d like to do on your
                                    honeymoon (and where you’d like to do them). For example, if it’s summertime in
                                    Australia, maybe you'll spend time at the beach, or swimming with dolphins or
                                    sharks! If it's winter in Japan, maybe try snowboarding on Mt Fuji!</li>

                                    Budgeting is important when planning a trip, even if it’s just a weekend getaway.
                                    The first thing to do is figure out how much you want to spend. Then, decide what’s
                                    most important to you: fancy hotels or cheap flights? A luxury cruise or exotic
                                    locales? Once that is decided, create a budget plan based on your priorities and
                                    stick with it!

                                        Saving money is a great idea, especially if you want to go on your honeymoon
                                        with as few worries as possible. So how do you save?

                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Create a separate savings account for your
                                            honeymoon fund. Add money to it regularly, and don't touch it unless it's
                                            absolutely necessary.</li>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Consider putting some of your money into a high
                                            interest savings account so that even more of the interest earned can be put
                                            towards funding the trip!</li>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Cut back on expenses by eating out less often,
                                            taking public transportation instead of taxis or rideshare services, getting
                                            good deals on travel sites like [your favorite one], etc. </li>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">This will help save some money while still
                                            leaving enough for fun things like shopping at local markets around town and
                                            exploring new places together!</li>

                                        You're going to need a travel itinerary, which is just a fancy way of saying "a
                                        map." Don't worry; this doesn't have to be fancy or detailed. You can get away
                                        with just using Google Maps or another online mapping service, although you may
                                        want to consider investing in an actual guidebook in case you want to wander off
                                        the beaten path.
                                    </p>

                                        There's no one right way to plan your trip—it all depends on what kind of
                                        honeymoon experience you're looking for. If your dream honeymoon involves
                                        climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and bungee jumping off Victoria Falls, then it makes
                                        sense that your travel itinerary would reflect those activities. But if all you
                                        care about is soaking up some sun on a beach somewhere exotic, then there's no
                                        need for anything more than booking flights from LAX (Los Angeles International
                                        Airport) and accommodations at Hotel Acapulco Beachside Resort & Bar.*

                                    <p class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">
                                        Plan B (or “Plan Be,” as I like to refer to it) is any alternate vacation you
                                        have in mind should your dream honeymoon be too expensive. And if you want the
                                        best value out of your money, plan B should be the plan that meets your budget
                                        and interests on a scale of 1-10. </p>
                                    <p class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">
                                        If you've read this far, then hopefully you understand why having a Plan B is so
                                        important: You need to have an alternative in case something goes wrong with
                                        your original plans—and believe me when I say something WILL go wrong. It's just
                                        how life works sometimes! So here are some ideas for creating a solid Plan Be:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Ask yourself what would make the trip seem like more than just another day on Earth? Your answer will help determine where else to take your honeymoon; maybe there's an under-the-radar location nearby that'll give both of us enough adventure while still fitting within our budget!</li>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Look at other destinations nearby or further away from home (cities within driving distance don't count). Do they offer cheaper hotels or flights? Are there better deals available during certain times of year? Or would going somewhere new feel like such an adventure in itself that even if it were cheaper than our first option, we'd still feel satisfied with ourselves upon returning home? There are plenty of questions worth asking yourself when considering locations outside one's comfort zone!</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">Use an app like Packing Pro to help you make sure that you don't forget anything important (like your passport).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h1 class="f-25 w-700">Set up a vacation autoresponder for work emails.</h1>

                                    <p class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">
                                        Travel insurance is not just something you need to have, but something you should be looking for. For most people, travel insurance is a line item on the honeymoon budget that gets skipped because it's "too expensive". In reality, it's one of the smartest investments you can make when planning your honeymoon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">
                                        In order to find the right travel insurance policy for your trip - here are some things you should know:                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">What kind of medical coverage do I need? Most basic policies cover emergency medical expenses and hospital stays up to around $25K USD (the price varies depending on additional coverage options)</li>
                                        <li class="f-18 w-500 text-dark">How much does it cost? The average annual premium from an independent agent was $740 in 2017 according to Travel Insurance Direct’s annual survey of travel agents. You can get quotes from other companies online as well if this price seems too high for your budget! I recommend checking out [INSERT URL HERE] .</li>
